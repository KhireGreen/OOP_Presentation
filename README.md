In TypeScript, static, protected, and private are three access modifiers that are used to control the accessibility of class members.

Static members are class-level members that can be accessed without creating an instance of the class. They are used to create members that are shared across all instances of the class. They are commonly used for utility methods, for example, to calculate some value that is common for all the instances of the class. Protected members, on the other hand, can be accessed only by the class and its subclasses, making them useful for creating members that can be overridden by subclasses. Private members are only accessible within the class and cannot be accessed by subclasses or outside of the class, making them useful for creating members that should only be used internally by the class.

In summary, static, protected, and private members are all useful when creating classes and managing class members in TypeScript. They are used to control the accessibility of class members, allowing you to make them available or inaccessible to different parts of your codebase. They help to promote good coding practices and make the codebase more readable, maintainable, and scalable. Therefore, it is advisable to use them when designing and building large and complex applications in TypeScript.
